# snap

An extensive snap tool/widget for Flutter that allows very flexible snap management and snapping between your widgets.
Inspired by WhatsApp's in-app Youtube player.

## Description
This is a very detailed snap tool/widget that allows very flexible snap management and snapping between your widgets. Just wrap
your *snapper* widget with the SnapController widget, fill the parameters, define your *snappable* widget and this package will 
take care of everything else.


## Notes
I started using and learning Flutter only some weeks ago so this package might have some parts that don't make sense, 
that should be completely different, that could be much better, etc. Please let me know! Nicely! 

Any help, suggestion or criticism is appreciated! 

Cheers.
